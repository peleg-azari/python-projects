# Opening

This repository showcases my Python skills through 3 data structures and algorithms projects, and 8 problem-solving questions.

Each project demonstrates different aspects of algorithmic thinking, data manipulation, and performance optimization.

while the coding questions highlight problem-solving approaches using Python's built-in functionalities.
